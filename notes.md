# git 
- commit early and often
- remotes
- adding/committing/pushing
# Middleware
- something that happens... in the middle!
- runs for every route that gets to that point.  (in the order the code executes, and only if the route matches)
- Think of it as a step in-between (1) request and (2) route matched and response sent back
# Routes: Order Matters!
# Static Directory
# POST requests and forms


# Today in the project:
- axios
- POST /job-search -> make it fetch jobs
- cowspiration/cowsay -> fetch quote
