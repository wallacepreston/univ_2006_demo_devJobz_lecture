# git 
- commit early and often
- remotes
- adding/committing/pushing
# modules

# Middleware
- What is middleware?
- Middleware does something between when the request comes in and when the route is hit and ultimately the response is sent back by another route... 
- something that happens in the middle!
- Sometimes we install a library for this
- sometimes we'll create our own middleware!
# Routes: Order Matters!

# Static Directory
# POST requests and forms

# Today in the project:
- axios
  - A new way of doing fetch, server-friendly!
  - I created a reference for axios, will be useful in the coming projects
- POST /job-search -> make it fetch jobs
- cowspiration/cowsay -> fetch quote
